Note pad 


To run the Notepad GUI tool example on different operating systems, you can follow these instructions for installation:

1. **Mac:**

   - Open the Terminal.
   - Navigate to the directory where you saved the Python script (`notepad_gui.py`).
   - Run the script using the `python3` command:

     ```bash
     python3 notepad_gui.py
     ```

2. **Windows:**

   - Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
   - Navigate to the directory where you saved the Python script.
   - Run the script:

     ```bash
     python notepad_gui.py
     ```

3. **Linux:**

   - Open the Terminal.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the Python script.
   - Run the script:

     ```bash
     python3 notepad_gui.py
     ```

Please note:

- You'll need to have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- If you encounter any issues related to package dependencies, you might need to install the necessary packages using `pip`. For example, if you're missing the `reportlab` package for PDF generation, you can install it with:

  ```bash
  pip install reportlab
  ```

Remember that the instructions above assume that your system has Python properly configured in the system's PATH. If you have multiple Python versions installed, make sure to use the appropriate version (`python` or `python3`), and ensure you are running the script from the correct directory.
